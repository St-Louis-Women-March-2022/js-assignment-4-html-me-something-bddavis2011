               <p>Tattooing is one of the oldest art forms around the globe. From the ways they were traditionally done with sticks, ink and thorns; to the way they’re done now, with coils and needles, there’s no denying that they’re here to stay.  And while we may not tattoo our bodies to show allegiances for our enemies to see, nor to show a status of wealth anymore; we can confidently say that there is a tattoo style that will appeal to anyone. Here I will talk about just some of the different styles and give some examples.</p>

               <h2 id = "Tribal">Tribal</h2>
               <p>It just doesn’t seem right to start our list with anything other than tribal. Tribal is one of the oldest styles of tattoos.  Some of the most widely known is the Polynesian style of tribal tattoos, thanks in large part to Disney and the movie Moana. Historically, Polynesian’s used tattoos with bold and distinctive signs to express their identity as well as to show their status, genealogy and rank within society. One of the best examples of this within the Maori people of New Zealand.</p>

               <h2 id = "trad-japanese">Traditional Japanese</h2>
               <p>Next on the list is Traditional Japanese.  Filled with symbolism and wrapped in beautiful colors, Traditional Japanese tattoos come with their own set of rules to follow. The tradition of tattoos in Japan started some time back in 10,000 B.C.  Women were seen wearing them most, using the art form to showcase vibrantly colored lips. Just a few of the rules include:</p>
               <ol><li> All the tattoos should be uniquely bright, using clean colors, rich in detailing and they should be big enough to cover a large area such as an arm, whole chest/back, or leg.</li>
                   <li>Japanese tattoos need to have symbols and themes to represent their culture.  Without it, it’s just a simple tattoo without meaning.</li>
                   <li>Most importantly, it is said that the design of the tattoo should only be done by the hands of the tattoo artist.  The technique used to design the unique pieces is called ‘Tebori’.</li>
               </ol>

               <h2 id = "Old-School">Old School</h2>
               <p>Moving right along brings us to Old School tattoos. Popularized in the 1930’s and 1940’s, these tattoos are known for their bold, single pass lines, rich blacks and limited color palettes. You may not be a tattoo aficionado, but I can almost guarantee you’ve seen a traditional tattoo in some form.  Whether it’s the classic image of the simple heart and banner with ‘MOM’ written on it, a classic gypsy girl, or a swallow in flight, old school tattoos are commonly seen.  Old School tattoos were made popular by sailors who would frequently get them done while on shore leave.  They’re usually simplistic designs that are meant to be done quickly so that the artist could get it done and move on to the next customer.</p>

               <h2 id="New-School">New School</h2>
               <p>After Old School, comes New School.  If old school was limited in color palettes, new school is all about bright, bold, wall to wall colors.  New school tattoos are characterized by the use of heavy outlines, vivid colors and exaggerated depictions of the subject.  “Cartoonish” is often the word used to describe this style.</p>

                  <p>There are several more, including black and gray, portraiture, realism, geometric, and watercolor just to name a few.  In short, if there’s something you like, and a specific style, chances are that someone has it tattooed.  Just be sure that you’re going to like the design forever before you get one!</p>
